## Why I went with Remix?
I have worked with Next.js in many projects and have used Gatsby in one of the proejcts. I haven't used Remix so thought that it might be a good way to explore the basics of remix. In the codebase, I havent used many remix components due to lack of time but I was able to get a grasp of the very basic understanding of the remix.

## Improvements that can be made
1. Proper type annotation
2. Using remix state and data flow management for managing different state
3. Improved Error Hanlding via toasts
4. Responsive Desgins
5. Proper UI/UX and a guide on what the site is about
6. Make the site a PWA

**Note**: I was not clear that if we upload a video with no audio after the video with audio will the inital one remain. Currently that video is also removed. If required, it can be easily handled by making a prevUploadedFile state and then using it for currentfile.
